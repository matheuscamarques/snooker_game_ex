defmodule SnookerGameEx.SpatialHashETS do
  @moduledoc """
  An implementation of a Spatial Hash data structure using an ETS table as the backend.

  A Spatial Hash is a grid-based data structure that is very efficient for uniformally
  distributed spatial data. It works by dividing the space into a grid of cells and
  storing entities in the cells they occupy. Queries for nearby objects only need to
  check the entities in the nearby grid cells, which is very fast.

  **IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED:**
  1.  **No Compile-Time Transform:** Removed the need for complex compile-time metaprogramming.
  2.  **Safe `clear/1`:** The clear function now correctly deletes only grid data, preserving the configuration.
  3.  **Optimized Queries:** Uses a safe, dynamically generated `match_spec` for efficient ETS queries.
  4.  **Stateful `cell_size`:** The grid's `cell_size` is now stored in the table's state.
  5.  **Concurrency-Ready:** Uses `write_concurrency: true` and atomic operations suitable for concurrent access.
